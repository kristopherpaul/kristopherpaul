<h3 align="center"><b>Machine Learning Engineer</b> | <b>Competitive Programmer</b> | <b>Undergraduate Researcher</b> | <b>Quant Consultant</b></h3>
<br>
I'm a third-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at IIT, Gandhinagar. I bring a strong academic foundation, coupled with a robust research background and solid problem-solving skills.

## Background
My journey into the world of programming began at the age of 8, and over the years, I have honed my skills in languages such as Java, C, and C++. As a testament to my dedication and skills, I became the youngest-ever finalist at the International Olympiad in Informatics Training Camp (IOITC) at the age of 13.

Subsequently, I achieved a peak rating of 2241 (6 stars - top 0.2%) on Codechef and 1937 (Candidate Master) at 15. My journey expanded into machine learning, where I won multiple hackathons, secured an ML internship at 17 in the R&D department of an NLP-focused startup, and co-authored a research paper on NLP published at the International Conference on NLP (ICON '22) when I was 18.

Continuing my research journey at IIT Gandhinagar, I worked under the guidance of Professor Anirban Dasgupta in theoretical machine learning. Notable contributions include exploring the construction of coresets of datasets to train neural networks and innovatively improving traditional Bloom Filters by incorporating machine learning.

## Interests
I am always open to challenging opportunities in the field of Machine Learning. Additionally, I am excited about the prospect of software development, where I can leverage my programming skills and problem-solving abilities to develop innovative solutions.
