### what I build
- **RISC‑V Emulator**: C‑based RISC-V emulator
- **OSL Compiler**: full lexer → parser → resolver → codegen; [docs](https://guntas-13.github.io/osl.docs/)
- **improvedPLBF**: ML-augmented Bloom filters
- **Platform**: algo-trading with real-time pipelines + AI for strategy generation
- **FraudCallDetector**: XLNet pipeline from tweets to prediction

### why it matters
> Systems should be fast, precise, and built with intent <br>
> I care about things that scale, generalize, and break well
